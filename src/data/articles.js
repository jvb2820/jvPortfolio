								I have always been fascinated by technology and artificial intelligence, which led me to pursue 
								a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. My journey in IT began with hands-on experience in customer support. 
								I started as a Technical Advisor at Concentrix (Comcast West 3P), where I worked for over a year, troubleshooting 
								and resolving technical issues while assisting customers. Seeking to expand my skill set, I then 
								took on a sales and customer service role at Amazon, where I learned to navigate various tools and 
								handle customer interactions effectively.  
				
								Driven by my passion for technology, I transitioned into the field of development. Now, as an IT intern at 
								Lifewood Data Technology, I am honing my skills in data processing, web development, and text and object 
								data collection, laying the foundations for a career in IT solutions and software development.

						My journey into IT started with simple curiosity. At first, I was just an observer in group projects, completing only 
						the tasks assigned to me. I had little knowledge of how applications worked as a whole. However, over time, I developed 
						a deep interest in understanding the full processâ€”how data is handled, how systems communicate, and how automation 
						can optimize workflows.
					</p>
					<p>
						Through self-learning and hands-on experience, I transitioned from merely contributing to projects to independently 
						building and managing full-stack applications. I started developing my own projects, such as this portfolio website, 
						and a test-run web development project for Lifewood.
					</p>
					<p>
						Along the way, I expanded my knowledge beyond development. I explored **database management**, **ServiceNow scripting**, 
						**Salesforce administration**, and **automation**. I also gained experience in **AI-driven solutions**, **data processing**, 
						and utilizing various IT tools to enhance efficiency.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Portfolio Website:</strong> A React-based portfolio showcasing my skills and projects.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Lifewood Website Project:</strong> A test-run web development project built to apply my front-end 
							and back-end expertise.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						My journey in IT is far from over. I continuously strive to learn more about modern development frameworks, cloud technologies, 
						and automation to further enhance my capabilities. Every project, every challenge, and every new tool I explore adds to my 
						growth as a developer and IT professional.
